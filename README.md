# angularchangedetector (Change Detector)

The main purpose of Change Detector is to make sure that data in the component and the view are the sync with each other.

The Change Detector detect the component for the data change and re-render the view to project the updated data.

Every component has its own Change Detector

Binding does not work for a component, if its change Detector is dettached.
